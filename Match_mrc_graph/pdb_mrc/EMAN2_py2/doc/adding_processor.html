<h2>Adding Processors to EMAN2</h2>
</div>
<br>
There are two mechanisms to add processors to EMAN2.&nbsp; The
first option involves editing templates in order to integrate the new
processor into the core while the second option involves directly
altering the existing processor files.&nbsp; It is generally
recommended that processors be added first using templates and later
added to existing core if desired.&nbsp; When testing or altering a
new processor build time are much faster if templates are
used.&nbsp; Add directly to the existing processor files when you
have code that is completely refined. <br>
<br>
<br>
<h3 style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);"><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">I.&nbsp;
Using Templates:</span></h3>
<br>
General Overview:<br>
1.&nbsp; Edit processor_template.h and
processor_template.cpp&nbsp;located in EMAN2/src/eman2/plugins<br>
2.&nbsp; From EMAN2/src/build run:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; % make<br>
<br>
Located in the plugin directory of the EMAN2 source (i.e.
EMAN2/src/eman2/plugins) are various template files including
processor_template.h and processor_template.cpp.&nbsp; These are
the files that will be used for new processor installation.&nbsp;
Begin by editing processor_template.h. <br>
<br>
<ol>
  <li>Change the occurrences of "XYZ" in "XYZProcessor" with the
name of&nbsp;the new
processor&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
- Don't forget to change the string in get_name() to the name
of&nbsp;the processor (this is the name that will be used to call
the processor)</li>
  <li>Edit the string in get_desc() with a brief description of
the processor.&nbsp; Place a more detailed descriptions elsewhere
such as&nbsp;before the class or before the functions (link to
coding_style)</li>
  <li>Define the processor's parameters in
get_param_types()&nbsp;<br>
-&nbsp; A description string can be added as a third param to the
TypeDict::put()&nbsp;function to describe the variables</li>
  <li>&nbsp; In the class constructor of FilterFactorExt
uncomment the line&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
"Factory &lt; Processor &gt;::add(&amp;dProcessor::NEW);"</li>
</ol>
<br>
Now edit processor_template.cpp<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5. In processor() add the implementation
code of the new processor.<br>
<ul>
  <li>&nbsp;&nbsp; - The existing template has sample
code showing how to access the variables that where defined in
get_para_types()</li>
  <li>&nbsp;&nbsp; - Note that the sample code included
in the template is enclosed in a conditional statement that essentially
causes all of the code to be skipped.</li>
  <li>&nbsp;&nbsp; - Also note that it may be necessary
to add "include "emdata.h" to this file in order to use EMData member
functions.</li>
</ul>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6. % indent processor_template.h
processor_template.cpp<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
Finally rebuild EMAN2: <br>
<br>
% cd ../../build<br>
% make<br>
<br>
The new processor should now be available using the name that was<br>
specified in get_name().<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h3 style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);"><span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">II. Adding
directly to the core:</span></h3>
<br>
If the new processor code has already been created using the supplied
templates, then adding to the core can be done as follows:<br>
<br>
<ol>
  <li>Open processor.h in src/eman2/libEM</li>
  <li>Copy the class you defined in processor_template.h and
pasteit in the file </li>
  <li>Open processor.cpp (also located in src/eman2/libEM)</li>
  <li>Copy and paste the class from processor_template.cpp to
processor.cpp</li>
  <li>In the template class Factory located in the begining of
processor.cpp add a line "force_add(&amp;newProcessor::NEW)" where
"newProcessor" is the name of the processor class that is being added</li>
  <li>Rebuild EMAN2</li>
</ol>
<br>
The instructions for adding a new processor without first using
templates go as follows:<br>
<br>
<ol>
  <li>In src/eman2/libEM open processor.h</li>
  <li>Towards the end of the file there is an example class
called XYZProcessor.&nbsp; Follow the first 3 steps listed in
"Using Templates".</li>
  <li>Open processor.cpp and write an implementation for the
process() function that was just defined in processor.h</li>
  <li>In the template class Factory located in the beginning of
processor.cpp add a line "force_add(&amp;newProcessor::NEW)" where
"newProcessor" is the name of the processor class that is being added</li>
  <li>Rebuild EMAN2</li>
</ol>
