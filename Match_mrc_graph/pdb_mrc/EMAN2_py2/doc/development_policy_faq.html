<br>
This document summarizes the basic policy for EMAN2 development,
especially on how to contribute your code to EMAN2. The intened
audiences are EMAN2 developers.</font>
<p style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);"><font size="+1">Q. <span
 style="font-style: italic;">What is the current eman2
development model?&nbsp; Anybody with cvs
access &nbsp;can change anything, or is there a "gatekeeper" who adds
patches
to the current code, and thus has ultimate authority over what gets
into &nbsp; the program?&nbsp; What I mean is who decides whether a
given
change is &nbsp;desirable or not?&nbsp; Do you care if something that
you are
philosophically &nbsp;opposed to gets added to the code? </span></font></p>
<p><font size="+1">A. There
aren't THAT many people with CVS access right now, so it isn't
a major issue yet. As it stands now, anyone with CVS access is
permitted
to check changes in. Certainly anyone is allowed to add completely new
routines, like new processors, new reconstruction routines, etc. </font></p>
<p style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);"><font size="+1">Q. <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Is
there a policy about changing code submitted by somebody else?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Similarly, is there anything that prevents (or
facilitates) having &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; several groups working on the
same piece of code.</span></font> </p>
<p><font size="+1">A. CVS automatically allows people to work on the
same code
simultaneously. If two people make conflicting changes (ie - change the
same line of code), then the person who checks their changes back into
CVS last has
to go through the 'merging' process before CVS allows their changes to
be committed. ie - <br>
</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font size="+1">cvs checkout by A and B </font></li>
  <li><font size="+1">A and B make
conflicting changes to a particular file </font></li>
  <li><font size="+1">A checks his changes back
in </font></li>
  <li><font size="+1">B tries to check his changes in, gets a message
saying the code
has &nbsp;&nbsp; already been changed, and he must resolve conflicts
first </font></li>
  <li><font size="+1">B does a cvs update, which will put BOTH versions
of the
changed code &nbsp;&nbsp; into the appropriate file. B must then
manually update the
code to reflect &nbsp;&nbsp; a single changed version. </font></li>
  <li><font size="+1">B checks his
changes in. </font></li>
</ol>
<p><font size="+1">Note that, a record still exists of A's changes, so
if B
changes
something in a bad way, it is still possible to check out A's version.
Regarding changing someone elses code, I am certainly concerned about
the issue of someone 'fixing' something and unintentionally breaking
it. For now, please check with me before you spend time changing an
existing piece of code. If there is a good reason to leave it as it is,
you can simply make a different routine with the desired functionality.
However, if something is really broken, or can be substantially
improved, I'm all in favor of this happening. Just drop me a quick
message explaining what you intend.&nbsp; For example, the background
fitting routine you
described in this message was never actually completed, and did not
work, so putting
in a functional version is a welcome addition. </font></p>
<p style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);"><font size="+1">Q. <span
 style="font-style: italic;">What's the policy of
changing someone else's code?</span></font> </p>
<p><font size="+1">A. I agree in general that changing
someone elses code should only be
done with permission of the original author. I would (for now) still
like to act as a clearinghouse for this sort of activity, because there
may be issues that the original author isn't even aware of. It is
always
possible to find out who wrote a particular routine through CVS, but
this can be
a bit annoying to accomplish. Right now we put author stamps at the top
of each source code file. </font></p>
<p style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);"><font size="+1">Q.<span
 style="font-style: italic;"> Is it clear who wrote a particular piece
of code?</span></font> </p>
<p><font size="+1">A. It is always possible to find out who wrote a
particular
routine
through CVS, but this can be a bit annoying to accomplish. Right now we
put author stamps at the top of each source code file. Starting now,
why don't we set a policy that each new function/method
that is added to EMAN2 should have an author/date stamp in the
docstring for the method. I don't think this needs to extend to small
changes within a routine. It is always possible to check CVS for
detailed changes. </font></p>
<p style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);"><font size="+1">Q. <span
 style="font-style: italic;">User docs currently seem to be quite
thin.&nbsp;
Is that by
design?&nbsp; Moreover, do the auto-generated docs adequately allow
developers to determine how and by what a particular chunk of code is
used.&nbsp; Also, is there a simple way to find out whether a given
procedure used by multiple pieces of code and if yes, by which ones?</span></font>
</p>
<p><font size="+1">A.
Well, there aren't really any user docs yet because there aren't
really any user programs yet. There are just a few that we've started
writing over the last few weeks. These should all be internally
documented, ie <span style="font-family: monospace;">e2pdb2mrc --help</span>
will provide some documentation, but
this needs to be improved, and we
do need to develop a script to collect this information into web pages.
Right now our effort is mostly focused on programming, so the docs have
also focused that way. </font></p>
<p style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);"><font size="+1">Q. <span
 style="font-style: italic;">What is the reason for having monolithic
source files (such as &nbsp;<span style="font-family: monospace;">processor.cpp</span>)
instead of having separate
source files for each
distinct piece of code?&nbsp; There are advantages to both solutions...</span></font>
</p>
<p><font size="+1">A. Simply to prevent having too many source files
scattered around. If
every Processor was in an individual file, there would be a tremendous
number of files. As any particular file gets too large, we generally
split it
into a few smaller pieces. Since CVS takes care of the changes, and the
code
for a particular function can be localized within the source file,
there aren't any major problems with this approach.&nbsp; One problem
with the individual file method is that it tends to dramatically
increase build
and install times.&nbsp; This is a somewhat arbitrary policy. </font></p>
<p style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);"><font size="+1">Q. <span
 style="font-style: italic;">What
is the policy on "stolen" code (such as that taken from&nbsp;
Numerical Recipes)?</span></font> </p>
<p><font size="+1">A. Clearly taking obvious copyrighted code is a BAD
thing, especially
when it has been made clear that such use is not permitted. However, I
think NRC has actually relaxed their polices a bit recently. In most
cases equivalent publicly available code can be found. We have already
adopted GSL (Gnu Scientific Library), Opt++ and FFTW as dependencies.
So
routines from any of those toolkits can be used freely. If there are
other
toolkits you find you need, you need to talk to me before adding new
dependencies to EMAN2 as a whole. More dependencies are generally a bad
thing. </font></p>
<p style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);"><font size="+1">Q. <span
 style="font-style: italic;">May one incorporate pure C (or even pure
Fortran) routines,
particularly numerical routines, into eman2?</span></font>
</p>
<p><font size="+1">A. No
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Fortran.</span> This is strictly due
to the added compilation
difficulties it poses. Pure C is a bit trickier, I certainly have no
objections to C-like C++, but to work in the framework, the 'functions'
need to at least be defined as static methods in some classes, for
example, in Util class or EMUtil class. </font></p>
<p style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);"><font size="+1">Q. <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Is there a specification
somewhere that distinguishes fatal from recoverable errors?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></font> </p>
<p><font size="+1">A. We are trying to adopt
try/except exception processing for errors.
The details for this are still being worked out. Fatal errors should be
avoided if possible in the libraries, but when they occur, we should
have a central routine to log the error and exit (EMAN1 did).&nbsp;
This is
in flux right now I'd say. </font></p>
<p style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);"><font size="+1">Q. <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Are operations on arrays / matrices
defined anywhere in the code? &nbsp;Similarly, why does the EMData
class define an image as a
low-level &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C chunk of memory, with the user
constantly
performing on-the-fly index calculations?</span></font>
</p>
<p><font size="+1">A.
&nbsp; Using C++ abstractions for the low level
image storage (like an array of arrays) generally imposes a substantial
speed penalty. There IS a higher level abstraction for accessing the
image data get_value_at,
set_value_at, etc. These are generally inlined functions, so the ones
that don't check limits are pretty much the same speed as doing the
index calculations yourself. Currently there aren't any routines for
treating EMData
objects as vectors/matrices/tensors, but this could be done. Liwei did
make a matrix class, but this is used strictly for transformation
matrices (3x3 or 4x4).&nbsp; GSL has a large set of matrix math
routines. The main
reason we haven't settled on anything is that we haven't completely
decided on a particular linear algebra suite. We could use numpy
Python array on
the python side, but this wouldn't provide C++ functionality. We could
use GSL, but then
we need to expose all of the appropriate routines on the python side,
or we could decide to go full bore and adopt something like
Lapack.&nbsp;
This is still open for debate... </font></p>
<p style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);"><font size="+1">Q. <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Is there a testing policy or
framework?</span></font> </p>
<p><font size="+1">A. We would like to have a full set of unit-tests,
so every
method in
EMAN2 will have a corresponding test. We are working on this. Bugfixes
are still a higher priority right now. If you guys are actively working
on EMAN2, I would strongly suggest doing frequent CVS updates. Wen and
I have begun writing user-level programs now, and finding many bugs,
which are rapidly
getting fixed. Still, there are probably quite a few problems. </font></p>
<p style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);"><font size="+1">Q. <span
 style="font-style: italic;">How
does eman2 report results (such as a goodness-of-fit, etcetera) to the
user when manipulating images?&nbsp;
The LOG facility appears to &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; exist mainly for
error/warning
reporting.&nbsp; Some commands can produce copious output, foe example
the ramp removal can print the coeffs of the fit.&nbsp; Should they be
printed, and if yes, where?</span></font> </p>
<p><font size="+1">A. Here is what I would propose: <br>
</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font size="+1">In
general, low level algorithms should not produce textual output aimed
at the user. They should return appropriate values, then the user-level
program can decide what to display. </font></li>
  <li><font size="+1">If you really need, at least
optionally, to produce output from
within a C++ algorithm, use the LOG mechanism. By changing the <span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: monospace;">LOG</span>
priority before making the function call, the higher level program can
then
decide whether the output should be generated or not. Lots of printing
in high performance algorithms can have a severe impact on performance,
so this should be avoided where possible. </font></li>
  <li><font size="+1">most user level programs
should provide a<span style="font-family: monospace;">
--verbose=&lt;int&gt;</span>
option to set the verbosity level. The user level program would then do
appropriate things to implement this. This would generall be on a 0-9
scale with 0 being completely or almost completely silent and 9 being
extremely verbose. In many cases only one or two levels may exist. </font></li>
  <li><font size="+1">Note that image objects have an attribute
mechanism, which can be
used to store relevant, but indirect results. For example, say you
called a routine which aligns one 2D image to another. The resulting
aligned
image might have attributes set indicating the alignment parameters and
the goodness of fit.</font></li>
  <li><font size="+1">A note to 4, above, we are gradually adopting
the PDB/EBI standard attribute dictionary for many parameters, so we
may require that
algoritm specific attributes would be named in such a way that they are
unique.</font></li>
</ol>
